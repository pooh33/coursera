Project topic:Ideal location for opening a restaurant in New York City

Introduction:
Owning a restaurant can be a dream to most of us, but the competition is acute. There are a lot of excellent chiefs outside.
The location to set up the restaurant becomes the decisive factor to win the market.

Foursquare location data is used to execute my idea. An ideal location should consider the potential passenger flow, 
number of competitors, and race. The data is from Manhattan, New York.

Data:
New York location data from Foursquare is extracted along with Wikipedia to understand the population of different races in New York. 
After analyzing the ideal area, it is found that Manhattan is a good place to start a restaurant business.
Since the content of Wikipedia page is crowded with many sections ,and so it is difficult to extract specific area of data. 
Demographics of Manhattan data is manually extracted from Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Manhattan).
